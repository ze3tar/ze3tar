**Security Research • Offensive Security • Systems Analysis**

I work across **offensive security and software engineering**, focusing on **vulnerability analysis, adversarial reasoning, and system-level investigation**.  
My work centers on understanding how software and systems behave under stress, how weaknesses emerge in real environments, and how they can be systematically identified and analyzed.

My approach is **methodical, engineering-driven, and grounded in practical system understanding**.

## 🛠 Professional Interests

### Offensive Security
- Attack surface analysis and structured reconnaissance  
- Vulnerability research: logic flaws, memory issues, design weaknesses, and implementation errors  
- Exploitation methodology and controlled testing workflows  
- Privilege escalation reasoning and post-exploitation analysis  
- Understanding failure modes in complex software systems  

### Security Engineering & Systems
- Linux internals and secure configuration practices  
- Protocol behavior, traffic analysis, and service identification  
- Application architecture analysis and dependency risk evaluation  
- Development of minimal, reliable tooling for reconnaissance and testing  

### Research & Analysis
- Study of real-world attack techniques and defensive gaps  
- Reproduction and analysis of advisories, exploit chains, and proof-of-concept logic

I use these languages for:
- **Python**: reconnaissance tooling, automation, data analysis, and security research  
- **C / C++**: low-level systems analysis, memory behavior, and exploit fundamentals  
- **Assembly**: execution flow analysis, shellcode concepts, and introspection  
- **JavaScript**: web application logic analysis and client-side attack surfaces  
- **Bash / Zsh**: environment automation and operational scripting
