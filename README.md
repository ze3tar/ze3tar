Security Research • Offensive Engineering • Systems Analysis

I work across offensive security and software engineering with a focus on  
**vulnerability analysis, adversarial reasoning, and system-level investigation**.  
My work is centered on understanding how software behaves under pressure and how weaknesses emerge in real environments.

My approach is grounded, methodical, and engineering-driven.

Security Research • Offensive Security • Systems Analysis

I work across **offensive security and software engineering**, with a focus on  
**vulnerability analysis, adversarial reasoning, and system-level investigation**.  
My work centers on understanding how software and systems behave under stress,  
how weaknesses emerge in real environments, and how those weaknesses can be  
systematically identified and analyzed.

My approach is **methodical, engineering-driven, and grounded in practical system understanding**.

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-323330?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=F7DF1E" />
</div>

I use these languages for:
- **Python**: reconnaissance tooling, automation, data analysis, and security research  
- **C / C++**: low-level systems analysis, memory behavior, and exploit fundamentals  
- **Assembly**: execution flow analysis, shellcode concepts, and introspection  
- **JavaScript**: web application logic analysis and client-side attack surfaces  
- **Bash / Zsh**: environment automation and operational scripting

## Professional Outlook

I prioritize **clarity, technical accuracy, and ethical responsibility**.  
My focus is on developing a deep understanding of systems rather than relying on surface-level tooling, with the long-term objective of contributing to **robust, secure, and well-understood software systems**.

- Threat modeling and understanding attacker workflows  
- Data-driven pattern analysis and anomaly detection
