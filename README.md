Security Research • Offensive Engineering • Systems Analysis

I work across offensive security and software engineering with a focus on  
**vulnerability analysis, adversarial reasoning, and system-level investigation**.  
My work is centered on understanding how software behaves under pressure and how weaknesses emerge in real environments.

My approach is grounded, methodical, and engineering-driven.

## Professional Interests

### Offensive Security
- Attack surface analysis and structured reconnaissance  
- Vulnerability research: logic flaws, memory issues, and design weaknesses  
- Exploit methodology and controlled testing workflows  
- Privilege escalation logic and post-exploitation strategy  
- Understanding the architecture behind system failures  

### Security Engineering & Systems Understanding
- Linux internals and secure configuration disciplines  
- Protocol behavior, traffic analysis, and service identification  
- Application architecture and dependency risk evaluation  
- Writing minimal, dependable tooling for reconnaissance and testing  

### Research & Analysis
- Studying real-world attack techniques and defensive gaps  
- Reproducing advisories, exploit chains, and proof-of-concept logic  
- Threat modeling and understanding attacker workflows  
- Data-driven pattern analysis and anomaly detection

I use these languages for:
- **Python**: reconnaissance tooling, automation, analysis  
- **C / C++**: memory behavior, low-level research, exploit fundamentals  
- **Assembly**: shellcode concepts, introspection, understanding execution flow  
- **JavaScript**: web logic analysis, client-side attack surfaces  
- **Bash/Zsh**: environment automation, operational scripting
